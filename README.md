# Spotify Clone 2.0
A React Native clone for the music streaming app Spotify. [New and improved!](https://github.com/kylenguyen7/spotify-clone) Created for [CS 47](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs47/) at Stanford.

Interesting features: Uses Spotify API and authentication hook to fetch either your top tracks or a specified album. Uses React Navigation and a WebView to display details when clicking on a song. When you press the green play icon, it plays a preview of the song.

This project was created for a class assignment with some starter files and assets. For my specific contributions, see <a href="https://github.com/kylenguyen7/spotify-clone-2.0/blob/main/components/SongList.js" target="_blank">SongList.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kylenguyen7/spotify-clone-2.0/blob/main/App.js" target="_blank">App.js</a>.
